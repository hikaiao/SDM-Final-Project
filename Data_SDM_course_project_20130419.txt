Data for the Statistical Data Mining course project

Part I: Pick your own data.
 Data sets with at least one of the following characters:
 (a) Large data. More than 200 MB. 
 (b) High dimensional. More than 1000 dimensions.
 (c) Complex data structure. For example, they are from difference sources, 
     measured by different equipments and different time, with spatial structure, 
     temporal structure (time series), functional data, and so on.

For example:
1. Stock market profit prediction (or related problem)

2. Data from Knowledge Discovery in Data web pages.
   http://www.sigkdd.org/kddcup/index.php

3. Data from some data mining competition.
   For example http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx?d=UNESCO

4. .....


Part II: Select one from the following.

1. Gene expression and DNA methylation data.(with a paper) (~200 MB)
   Identify important DNA methylation positions related to diseases.  
   /data2/SDM/Data/Methylation

2. SNP (GAW16) data. (with papers) (4.5 GB) 
   (with Master thesis and example R codes)
   Identify important disease related SNP and genes.
   /data2/SDM/Data/SNP 

3. fMRI data (around 10 GB). 
   (with Master thesis and example R codes)
   Search meaningful active regions and test for differences for factors.
   /data2/SDM/Data/fMRI

4. DNA sequencing short reads data (phix174 and Cyano, around 6 to 20GB)
   (with slides and papers, and example R codes) 
   Identify bad reads and assemble the genome.
   /data2/SDM/Data/seq

5. Flynn lipid liver: molecular signatures finding for 
   certain disease. (with slides)(30GB)
   Pattern (image) recognition and classification 
  /data2/SDM/Data/Liver
